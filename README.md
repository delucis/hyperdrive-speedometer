# Hyperdrive Speedometer

This is an [Astro](https://astro.build) site that displays performance metrics for other Astro sites!

It is based on [Zach Leatherman](https://zachleat.com/)’s awesome [Speedlify](https://github.com/zachleat/speedlify/) tool and uses the same underlying measurement techniques.
